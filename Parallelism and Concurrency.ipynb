What `fork` does is create an identical copy of the program currently running, memory and all, and continues execution of both the original and the new process from that point on until the processes are joined back together or killed.

    "### 2.1 Threads vs Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a step back for a second to do a little theory.  There are two primary ways that parallelism is done (at the high level at least).  We just saw an example using *processes*, which are essentially entirely seperate programs that we launch by making a copy of our current program.  The second is threads, which unlike processes, share the same memory space as their parents and don't create entire copies of the program, but instead run together in parallel within a single process.  What this generally means is that threads tend to be much more light-weight and communication between threads is much simpler.  In Python, since we're not copying the entire global scope when making threads, we are less likely to run into issues when using complicated classes or functions because we don't have to worry about making sure they copy correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads do have their disadvantage though.  Since they share the same memory, you must be careful when modifying variables as to not have two threads trying to use and/or modify the same resources at the same time.  This usually is avoided by using a complex system of *barriers*, *locks*, *semaphores*, etc.  Using processes avoids this issue as they all have their own world they live in and don't bother each other.  Another disadvantage of threads is the infamous GIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Global Interpreter Lock* is a special *lock* object that the Python interpreter itself uses.  What it does is prevent the Python interpreter from interpreting more than one line at a time.  This is because the Python interpreter is not \"thread-safe\", i.e. it will run into some of the issues mentioned above under some circumstances.  There's a whole history behind the GIL, and a lot of frustrated people.  I would recommend reading up on it a bit simply because it's interesting.  For this notebook, all we need to know though is that it significantly impacts the performance of multithreading in Python.  This performance impact can be significantly reduced if the code spends a lot of time doing things outside of Python.  A few examples being `numpy` functions which are typically written in C or FORTRAN, and device access such as file reading or downloading.\n",

We'll call these threads that are working on computing some function \"workers\".\n",

So not only are we not getting the benefit of parallelism, we may actually be running even slower because of the overhead of setting up the threads!

    "Python 3.2 introduced the `concurrent` module for single-threaded, multi-threaded, and multi-process concurrency.  The module `concurrent.futures` impliments a new way of writing concurrent code in Python using objects called `future` objects which are representative of some task that has either yet to take place or is still currently running.  These are similar to the \"workers\" we made above but with a much improved interface and don't necessarily correspond to a specific thread or process.  The library also introduces the concept of *executors*, which are similar to pools in that they manage the parallelism for us.  But unlike pools, they offer much greater control and flexibility with how we write and think about our code.  This library interfaces nicely with the new `async`/`await` syntax introduced in Python 3 but that will be a topic for another meeting.  The API and its ideas are used extensively in many modern dsitributed computing libraries for Python.\n",

    "### 3.1 Executors\n",
    "\n",
    "Before jump into the code, I'll introduce the concept of an *executor*.  An executor is an object that manages processes, threads, greenthreads, or other workers.  It contains both the functionality of pools and functionality similar to that of standalone `Process` or `Thread` objects.  They are initalized very similarly to a `Pool` object, in that they take as an argument the number of workers you want the executor to manage.  Executors offer two methods that make parallelism easy.  First, they have a `map` method which behaves almost exactly the same as that of `Pool` objects.  So already you might as well be using them over pools since they, at the minimum, are just as easy to use.  Second they have a `submit` method.  This method is sort of like instantiating a worker as we did before, but instead it submits a task.  You supply the method a function and its arguments, and the executor immediately takes over everything and starts running the tasks as soon as it can.  Like pools, executors will wait until they have the resources available before starting the task.  The `submit` method returns a `future` object.  Future objects represent the task that that was submitted to the executor and offer a way of interfacing with the task while waiting for the task to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Futures\n",

Futures offer methods of checking the status of the task, retrieving the results of the task, and modifying the task.  They are very convenient objects with a simple API allowing the user to interface with results that are coming in the future.  The `concurrent.futures` module, as well as other third party Python libraries, offer interfaces for easily dealing with `future` objects to make them as convenient as possible.  You can have Python block until a future finishes running and you can retrieve the results of a collection of futures asynchronously, working on the outputs as soon as they're ready.\n",
